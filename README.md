# Hot Takes ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥

Hot Takes is a debate app for important topics that guards against misinformation and logical fallacies, creating the optimal debate experience. Users can create debate threads with a predefined topic, which other users can click to begin a debate
Each debate starts with an AI-generated prompt summarizing the topic. One person is randomly chosen to start. Before each user submits their response, it will be scanned by AI for weaknesses or misinformation, and the user will be given one more chance to revise their response before sending.

## Project Overview 

### Inspiration
Just another dull day on reddit, scrolling r/AITAH and r/roastme for hours, inflicting small amounts of dopamine to your already fried brain receptors. "Trump and Zelenskyâ€”an intense exchange of fiery words and bold opinions." Into the comments, the insults flew, hurled from one side of the debate to the other. Overwhelmed by the raging debate, I scrolled to the top and continued doom scrolling... WAIT? 30K upvotes? That's pretty good... Come to think of it, these fierce controversial topics always do well on social media... The world needed a platform where people could passionately voice their thoughts without fear of censorship. Thatâ€™s when the idea for our app was born: a place where opinions clash, sparks fly, and the world can finally engage in the most outrageous debates. And thus, Hot Topic was bornâ€”because sometimes, you need a bombshell take to ignite a conversation!
